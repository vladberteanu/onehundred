                         “Dollar-cost averaging is achieved by buying equal dollar amounts of investments at regular intervals. It takes advantage of dips in the price and means that an investor doesn't have to be concerned about buying his or her entire position at the top of the market. Dollar-cost averaging is ideal for passive investors and alleviates them of the responsibility of choosing when and at what price to buy their positions.”

                            There will be times when the economy goes through so-called recessions. During these times people are afraid to invest in companies and the demand for your stocks will be lower. Consequently, the value of your stocks will be lower. Nevertheless, history shows that the economy always recovers and the value of your stock will go up again.
